/*
 A binary search requires an array that is already sorted.

The procedure:

    A binary search starts with the element in the middle of the array.

    If that element is the desired value, the search is over.

    Otherwise, the value in the middle element is either greater or less than the desired value.

    If it is greater than the desired value, search in the first half of the array.

    Otherwise search the last half of the array.

    Repeat as needed while adjusting the start and end points of the search.
